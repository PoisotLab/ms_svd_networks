  "description": "Defining the complexity of ecological networks has remained
  somewhat elusive. Primarily complexity has been defined on the basis of the
  structural (or behavioural) complexity of the system. The complexity of
  a network may be better defined by its physical properties and we present relative rank
  deficiency and SVD entropy as measures of 'external' and 'internal' complexity
  respectively. Using bipartite networks we find that ecological networks tend to have
  a very high complexity and that pollination (mutualistic?) networks are generally
  more complex when compared to other types of interactions. In addition we find
  that although SVD entropy relates to other structural measures of complexity
  (nestedness, connectance and spectral radius) it does not serve as an indicator
  of the resilience of a network when using simulated extinctions, which has
  previously been shown for structural measures of complexity. We argue that SVD entropy
  provides a fundamentally more 'correct' measure of network complexity and should
  be used moving forward.",
