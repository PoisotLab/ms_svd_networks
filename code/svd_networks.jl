# Generally, it is considered good practice to work in an environment, as it
# makes the management of dependencies a lot easier, and the project becomes
# more reproducible

## We then load the packages
using LinearAlgebra
using EcologicalNetworks
using Statistics
using Plots
using StatsBase

# For this type of projets, calling packages with using is fine, as the
# namespace is never going to get very big - one situation where you would want
# to use import instead is if you were using a package only in a single line
# (for example, using DataFrames but import CSV is fairly common)
